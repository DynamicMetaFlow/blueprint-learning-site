  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>The Computer Science for All (CS4All) Blueprint is an academic and implementation guide to teaching computer science in all New York City public schools. The content in this guide was collaboratively developed by the CS4All team at the NYC Department of Education and a select group of teacher fellows with experience teaching computer science in NYC public and charter schools. (link to teacher fellows page)</p>

  <p>The CS4All team and the teacher fellows incorporated the needs, values, and goals of the broad networks of stakeholders in bringing computer science education to every NYC school. A list of the stakeholder groups engaged and the important ideas and feedback they offered are summarized below.</p> 

  <p>With the first version of the Blueprint published, the CS4All team will seek to engage a new cohort of teacher fellows and more deeply engage with administrators to further develop the resources schools need to implement rigorous CS education for all students.</p>
