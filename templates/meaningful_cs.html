  <h1>What is a meaningful CS unit?</h1>
  <p>By 2025, every student in NYC will receive at least one meaningful unit of computer science instruction at every grade band- K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12. A meaningful unit of computer science engages students in:</p>
  <ul class="lst-kix_wljs7rlmwkb-0 start">
    <li>a creative application of computing that connections to students’ interests such as other academic subjects or real-world scenarios, </li>
    <li>a performance task that assesses students on their ability to think through open-ended tasks,</li>
    <li>hands-on experience with three CS practices - analyzing, prototyping, and communicating,</li>
    <li>at least three of five CS concepts - abstraction, algorithms, programming, data, and networks </li>
  </ul>
  <p>To help educators understand the criteria and see them in practice, CS4ALL is providing <a href="/units">exemplar units</a>. Units are written by educators from different parts of the CS education community - K-12 CS teachers, CS education academics, and teaching artists and practitioners. Units range in instructional time from 10-25 hours. Units for earlier grades and those that align with other subject areas tend to be shorter.</p>

  <p>Units aligning with other subject areas can help teachers make CS relevant to students by providing multiple entry points for CS content.These units highlight areas in published curriculum or standards that can help teachers leverage what students have learned in other subject areas  to provide their students with a meaningful CS experience. These units build on prerequisite content knowledge of other subject in order to give students opportunities to make meaningful connections.</p>

  <h2>Assessment: Performance Tasks</h2>
  <p>Performance tasks support CS4ALL’s emphasis on creative computing by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>asking students to complete an open-ended task appropriate for their age that requires application of knowledge and skills to an authentic prompt or problem.</li>
    <li>assessing students on multiple criteria and don’t expect students to find the “right” answer.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Educators should evaluate student artifacts using multiple criteria that ask students to create artifacts for each CS practice: Analyze, Prototype, and Communicate. This criteria is not to be taken literally. One artifact may incorporate all practices, so educators are encouraged to be thoughtful about what they ask students to do. Furthermore, open-ended tasks look different at different grade levels, so educators will need to find the right mix of scaffolding, guidance, and independence appropriate for their students.</p>
  <p>Examples of artifacts at different grade levels may include:</p>
  <h4>Analyze</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>K-5: an illustration of the physical internet</li>
    <li>6-8: a critique of a peer’s prototype</li>
    <li>9-12: written analysis of a government data source</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Prototype</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>K-5: a sequence of instructions for a robot to complete a simple maze</span></li><li>6-8: an interactive story or simulation</li><li>9-12: a script, or short program, that provides recommendations based on individuals’ input</li></ul>
    <h4>Communication</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>K-5: a verbal explanation of the components of a classroom device like a laptop or tablet</li>
      <li>6-8: a website that showcases a prototype and the iterative process</li>
      <li>9-12: written reflection that discusses the concepts associated with calling a function</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finally, educators should write performance task criteria for students and share criteria early and often with them.</p>

    <h2>Scope: CS Practices, Concepts, and Perspectives</h2>
    <p>A meaningful unit as described in the Blueprint represents the minimum instruction required as part of CS4ALL. Schools are expected to teach atleast all three CS practices, Analyze, Prototype, and Communicate, and three of five concepts, Abstraction, Algorithms, Programming, Data, and Networks. </p>
    <p>Each practice and concept consist of sub-practices and subconcepts. Educators are expected to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>engage students in as many sub-practices of the three practices - analyze, prototype, communicate - as is appropriate for their students’ age and background.</li>
      <li>engage students in at least one subconcept in at least three concepts areas - abstraction, algorithms, programming, data, network</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Scoping for student age and background</h3>
    <p>The level of engagement with practices and the choice of subconcepts can be guided utilizing four perspectives to CS education: Explorer, Creator, Innovator, and Citizen. For example, an educator working with students with no prior experience with computation may scope their unit using Explorer perspective, which focuses on giving students time to play and gain comfort with CS practices and concepts.</p>
    <p>Educators should consider this as the floor for meaningful CS units. As they gain CS content knowledge and experience implementing CS instruction, they are encouraged to add more concepts and to look at CS educational frameworks with broader scopes such as the K-12 CS Framework or AP CS Principles Framework.</p>
