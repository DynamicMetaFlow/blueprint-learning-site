  <h1>CS Concepts and Practices</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</span></h2>
  <p><span>Computer science is the exploration and application of computing practices and concepts. </span><span>Some of the most common applications of computer science (CS) is to</span><span>&nbsp;program computers to do tasks including finding information, enabling communication, or increasing productivity. However</span><span>&nbsp;computers are </span><span>increasingly</span>
    <span>&nbsp;programmed in a wide range of fields to create visual art and music, build scientific simulations, or analyze and even generate literature.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>Concepts</span><span>&nbsp;commonly applied across the diversity of computing applications. We introduce CS vocabulary and try to demystify concepts by presenting parallel examples of the other subjects. We also set the bar for a </span>
    <span>&nbsp;that schools should aim to provide to all of their students.</span>
  </p>
  <h2><span>Practices</span></h2>
  <p>The CS practices below are methods to explore computer science. Each practice is defined &nbsp;will require time for students to apply concepts, synthesize information from multiple sources, and design and create artifacts.</span>

    <span>.</span>
  </p>
  <h2><span>Concepts</span></h2>
  <p>Computer science concepts provide a framework for what a computer can and cannot do. There are five top level concepts, each with multiple subconcepts: 1) Abstraction, 2) Algorithms, 3) Programming, 4) Data, 5) Networks.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>.</span>
  </p>
  <h2>Meaningful CS Unit</span></h2>
  <p>The goal of Computer Science for All is to provide every student in NYC with a meaningful unit of computer science instruction at every grade band (K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12) by 2025. Meaningful units of CS engage students in:</span>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>,</span>
    </li>
    <li>appropriately levelled by grade,</span>
    </li>
    <li>appropriately levelled by grade,</span>
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;that assesses students on their mastery of concepts &amp; practices.</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Practices (P)</span></h2>
  <h2>&nbsp;the impacts of computing (AN)</span></h2>
  <p><span>Government, industry, and large organizations use the principles of computing to program computers to handle banking, surveillance, communication, and manufacturing. </span><span>In between,</span>
    <span>&nbsp;a diversity of groups use computing and computers to:</span>
  </p>
  <p>- accomplish complex tasks like driving cars, playing Jeopardy, or sequencing genes</span>
  </p>
  <p>- express themselves through graphics, games, or creative computing</span>
  </p>
  <p>- steal money, property, or information</span>
  </p>
  <p>- automate small or mundane tasks</span>
  </p>
  <p><span>- make decisions like forecasting the weather, recidivism, or amount of traffic</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p><span>These are just a few examples. The breadth and depth of computing are growing fast. People of all backgrounds must evaluate and respond to the ways that computing is affecting their lives, their families and friends, and </span><span>the systems in which they live</span>
    <span>. In order to analyze the social impacts of computing, students should:</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    </span>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>&nbsp;of computing by detailing who, what, where, when. Try to describe the application with data and by highlighting the relevant computing concepts</span>
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;the description and the data for patterns, general characteristics, or anomalies. Ask specific questions related to computing concepts</span>
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;the trends or insights from your analysis by looking for evidence to support an explanation. Test the evidence by researching similar cases, running experiments, or creating models.</span>
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;the application of computing based on your investigation. What are the benefits and harms, to who, how much, when and how? What are potential modifications and the arguments for and against?</span>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>&nbsp;(PR)</span></h2>
  <p><span>Computer science concepts are best explored and understood through hands-on experience building projects that are connected to students&rsquo; interests. CS concepts are tangible when applied using the &quot;Engineering Design Process&quot;: Ask, Research, Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve (see reference below). The final step in the </span><span>EDP</span><span>&nbsp;is Improve. In order to improve a prototype it is very important for students to ask for strong formative feedback from peers or teammates and to maintain a growth mindset so they can repeat the steps of the EDP (</span>
    <span>). The process should be repeated as much as time allows because not only does it help students develop their prototypes, but it also helps students build a mental model of computing concepts.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>notional machine</span><span>. &quot;A robust mental model of a notional machine means that you can talk about what a computer can do, completely apart from what a computer is doing in any particular role or function.&quot; (</span>
    <span>Guzdial</a>
      </span><span>, 24 May 2012). </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>Ada Lovelace</a>
    </span><span>, </span>
    <span>Grace Hopper</a>
      </span><span>, and </span><span>Margaret Hamilton</a></span>
    <span>&nbsp;followed a process like the EDP in order to build up to an understanding of what a computer can do.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;build prototypes using the following steps:</span>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>: identify the need &amp; constraints</span>
    </li>
    <li>: the problem using trusted sources, interviews, etc.</span>
    </li>
    <li>ideation techniques</span>
    </li>
    <li>: select a promising solution and identify materials, timeline, and group roles</span>
    </li>
    <li>: build a prototype to test solution using paper, digital media, or code</span>
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;through user testing or formative feedback</span>
    </li>
    <li>: repeat process using feedback to identify new needs and constraints</span>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3></span></h3>
  <h2>&nbsp;understanding of computing concepts (CO)</span></h2>
  <p>Students are expected to explain their thinking in writing or orally in computer science as they are in all subjects. They must communicate their analysis of computing impacts and how they applied computing concepts while prototyping projects. In addition
    to written and verbal communication, CS gives students a chance to express themselves through their prototypes. For example, a student that wants to display:</span>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>her understanding of algorithms can write her program to explain to the user each step in her algorithm as it is happening.</span>
    </li>
    <li>comments</span>
      <span>&nbsp;in the program</span>
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;program that fact checks sample articles that users like</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>To communicate understanding of computing concepts, students should:</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    </span>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>&nbsp;Focus on concepts central to the students&rsquo; work, concepts the student understands deeply through application.</span>
    </li>
    <li>Consider and plan on presenting ideas to broader audiences - the entire class, all teachers in the school, the community, etc. Empathize and think critically about the backgrounds, knowledge, and values of the audience.</span>
    </li>
    <li>Select media that will reach the intended audience, interactive programs, video, audio, slide decks, blog posts, papers, or instructional activities.</span>
    </li>
    <li>Explicitly show and explain the application of a computing concept by showing code from a prototype and explaining its significance in the program or by creating a relevant example that explains the concept and how it can be used.</span>
    </li>
    <li>Present or publish the work and receive formative feedback in the form of question and answer, comments, or user testing. Publishing work and capturing feedback as part of digital portfolios helps work persist after the unit or class ends.</span>
    </li>
  </ol>
